# @profoundlogic/hogan

A maintained fork of [Hogan.js](https://github.com/twitter/hogan.js) by [Profound Logic](https://www.profoundlogic.com).

This fork removes deprecated dependencies (notably `mkdirp`) and ensures compatibility with modern versions of Node.js while maintaining full API compatibility with the original Hogan.js templating engine.

- **Original project:** https://github.com/twitter/hogan.js  
- **This fork:** https://github.com/ProfoundLogic/hogan.js-ProfoundLogic  
- **npm:** https://www.npmjs.com/package/@profoundlogic/hogan

## Installation

```bash
npm install @profoundlogic/hogan
Usage
js
Copy code
const Hogan = require('@profoundlogic/hogan');

const template = Hogan.compile('Hello {{name}}!');
console.log(template.render({ name: 'World' })); // Hello World!
Why this fork?
hogan.js is no longer maintained and depends on an outdated version of mkdirp, causing deprecation warnings in downstream packages.
This fork replaces mkdirp with native Node.js file operations and will be maintained by Profound Logic.
